2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PRINT/data_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PRINT/data_reg_i_2/O, cell PRINT/data_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port JA[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
